# Goal
------------
I will master "Up and Running (3rd)" and aim to research improving network traffic handling in load balancing in the future.


### Chapter 6 : Labels and Annotations
Q1 : When setting matchLabels in a deployment, does it also search for pods managed by other deployments?

### Chapter 10 : Deployments
q2 : If you set the minReadySeconds parameter, it helps ensure that a Pod is functioning correctly and not just initially ready. However, where is the separate simulation conducted to determine the potential for subsequent errors in Pod operation?


### Week 4 clear, Reading New Paper relate to load balancing
